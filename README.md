I used React as it is what I have used the most to create any web application. I do prefer to use Typescript but chose not to as this was only a small project.

I used Tailwind CSS as it was the easiest/fastest way for me to create some styling without writing custom css.

My prefered state storage solution is Redux, this was a bit unecessary for a small application like this however I encountered some bugs when trying to get the component to rerender using the react state and props. Redux solved this problem for me.

If I had more time I would implement the multi by offer in the checkout section as it currently adds up each price individually, my initial thoughts on doing this would be to check the items in the basket against any multi buy quantities and then removing those items from the basket and adding a speacial multi buy item which would have the multi buy price. I would also look at improving the code readability and the styling of the webpage.
